This library is quite literally lifted off of one Bruce Hauman's examples for how
one could use Figwheel. This bit of code is just here to cleanly provide
a place that a person could reference his code. No credit is due to me at all, other
than for uploading this to Clojars.

### Usage

Wherever you might be running tests on Figwheel, require `jobim.figwheel.helper`, and
you will get the nice little test runner made by Hauman. It's really nice and helpful.
I made it as an easy thing to include in my [jobim](https://github.com/MysteryMachine/jobim)
library, but it's good for any ClojureScript project that needs testing.
